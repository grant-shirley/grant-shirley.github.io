    <h2>Educational Resources</h2>
    <p><a href="https://talkingmathwithkids.com/wodb/" target="_blank">Which One Doesn't Belong?</a> - This resource is a great conversation starter to encourage students to talk about math! The page contains several different categories of open-ended "Which One Doesn't Belong" questions with four choices. Each of the four has something different, so there's no right or wrong answer, just a tool for sparking math discussion!</p>
    <p><a href="https://mathsbot.com/manipulatives/tiles" target="_blank">Algebra Tiles</a> - This resource is a good digital manipulative for students to see a visual representation of simple math equations, and develop an intuitive sense of algebraic manipulation. The website contains a number of examples of different operations which can be demonstrated using algebra tiles, from simple arithmetic to multi-step algebraic equations. This can be a great tool to demonstrate zero pairs, inverse operations, and keeping track of negative signs.</p>
    <p><a href="https://polypad.amplify.com/" target="_blank">Polypad</a> - This resource is another virtual manipulative, which helps students visualize and manipulate polygons, polyhedra, fractions, balancing equations, functions, data visualization, and a number of other features. This could be enormously helpful for visual learners or anyone having a hard time developing an intuitive understanding of course material. I haven't used it extensively yet, but I plan on learning it well enough to be able to use it for instruction!</p>
