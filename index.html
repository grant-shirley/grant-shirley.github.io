    <h2>Research</h2>
<p>My research interests so far have been combinatorics, graph theory, and discrete statistics, and I'm open to collaboration on projects in those areas, as well as number theory, matroid theory, and mathematical physics! The following are three of the summer REU projects that I'm currently working with fellow students to prepare for submission to journals, along with slides I've used to present them, either at conferences or to REU colleagues:</p>
    <h3>REU Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Fubini Rankings and the Hunt for the Lucky Statistic</strong><br>
            Used combinatorics and discrete statistics to study sets of parking functions and their properties.
		<a href="REU_2024_Ponce___Lucky_Cars-8.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides]</a>
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>deBruijn Cycles: A Novel Approach</strong><br>
            Used graph theory and combinatorial methods to approach original applications of deBruijn's Theorem to mathematical objects including injective functions, ranked permutations, and multisets.
		<a href="Ucycles2023-7.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides]</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
I've also continued work on deBruijn cycles with a professor at ETSU to prepare the following for submission:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Universal Cycles of Integer Partitions and Compositions</strong><br>
            Used graph theory and combinatorial methods to study deBruijn cycles of specialized integer sequences.
		<a href="Ucycles_and_Gucycles_of_Integer_Compositions_and_Partitions-6.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides]</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
The following is a project I've worked on with an REU group but we are not currently preparing for submission:
    <ul>
      <li>
          <strong>Rose Conjecture: Total Acquisition on Diameter Two Graphs</strong><br>
          Used methods from graph theory, combinatorics, probability, and matrix theory to approach an unproven conjecture from a previous REU session regarding a property of bipartite multigraphs. As of yet, it remains unproven but we are continuing to work on it.
