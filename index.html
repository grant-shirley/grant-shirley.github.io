    <h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Thanks for visiting! My name is Grant Shirley, and I'm an undergraduate math major/physics minor interested in discrete math, probability and statistics, and mathematical physics. I am excited about math history, and an enthusiastic advocate for accessibility in mathematics. Outside of math, I spend a lot of time making music; I sing tenor in a barbershop quartet, I sing bass for an a cappella group, and I play the sousaphone in ETSU's marching band! I'm currently preparing to apply to PhD programs in mathematics, and am hoping to specialize in combinatorics or probability and statistics.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
<p>My research interests so far have been combinatorics, graph theory, and discrete statistics, and I'm open to collaboration on projects in those areas, as well as number theory, matroid theory, and mathematical physics! The following are three of the summer REU projects that I'm currently working with fellow students to prepare for submission to journals, along with slides I've used to present them, either at conferences or to REU colleagues:</p>
    <h3>REU Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Fubini Rankings and the Hunt for the Lucky Statistic</strong><br>
            Used combinatorics and discrete statistics to study sets of parking functions and their properties.
		<a href="REU_2024_Ponce___Lucky_Cars-8.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides]</a>
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>deBruijn Cycles: A Novel Approach</strong><br>
            Used graph theory and combinatorial methods to approach original applications of deBruijn's Theorem to mathematical objects including injective functions, ranked permutations, and multisets.
		<a href="Ucycles2023-7.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides]</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
I've also continued work on deBruijn cycles with a professor at ETSU to prepare the following for submission:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Universal Cycles of Integer Partitions and Compositions</strong><br>
            Used graph theory and combinatorial methods to study deBruijn cycles of specialized integer sequences.
		<a href="Ucycles_and_Gucycles_of_Integer_Compositions_and_Partitions-6.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides]</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
The following is a project I've worked on with an REU group but we are not currently preparing for submission:
    <ul>
      <li>
          <strong>Rose Conjecture: Total Acquisition on Diameter Two Graphs</strong><br>
          Used methods from graph theory, combinatorics, probability, and matrix theory to approach an unproven conjecture from a previous REU session regarding a property of bipartite multigraphs. As of yet, it remains unproven but we are continuing to work on it.
	      <a href="Rose_Lovasz_2024-3.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides]</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Joint Mathematics Meetings 2024</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Presented the following at AMS Contributed Paper Session on Combinatorics, V</li>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Rose Conjecture: Total Acqisition on Diameter Two Graphs</li><br>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Society of Physics Students 2024 Zone 8 Meeting</strong></li><br>
        <li><strong>Mathematics Association of America 2024 Southeast Section Meeting</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Presented the following at Special Session: Theory of Integer Sequences</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Universal Cycles of Integer Partitions and Compositions</li>
